FIXME: I'm not sure but this line should be here to render next paragraph

I work as a DevOps engineer with a strong development background. My experience includes designing and managing infrastructure on AWS, running and scaling workloads with Kubernetes, and implementing Infrastructure as Code using Terraform. I focus on setting up and maintaining full development pipelines with CI/CD, improving developer workflows, and ensuring systems are reliable, scalable, and easy to operate.

Before specializing in DevOps, I worked as a backend and full-stack developer with PHP and JavaScript. Iâ€™m still active in programming and currently write code in Python, Golang, PHP, and JavaScript. I enjoy building backend services, exploring system-level programming, and applying software engineering practices to both infrastructure and application development.
